This is a beginners project where I will try to build the Google homepage (the 
simple one with just a search box) with the help of the developer tools
available in the browser and by googling

I am not looking to replicate the functions, only the looks. There will be no
form submissions or dropdown menus etc

By completing this I am hoping to demonstrate that I am able to work with
basic HTML and CSS
